# Control_System_Project_EEE_4606
A University Project on Control System Engineering developed in MATLAB. The project analyzes the improvement in "Load Frequency Control" through the applcation of PID controller. The project is fully software based that provides a clear insight about the use of PID in Control Systems.

Load Frequency Control (LFC) is essential for maintaining short-term stability in power systems, as it continuously ensures that generation matches demand and the system frequency remains near its nominal value (50/60 Hz). Sudden load changes, generator outages, or other disturbances can cause frequency deviations, potentially damaging equipment or triggering cascading blackouts if not corrected promptly. Open-loop responses are insufficient because they leave steady-state errors and respond slowly. To address this, modern power systems use feedback control—most commonly Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers—to regulate the governor–turbine system and restore frequency to its nominal value.

This project presents a single-area LFC simulator built with an interactive MATLAB GUI. The interface allows users to configure system parameters (Tg, Tt, H, D, R), adjust PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) with derivative filtering, enable or disable anti-windup, and apply load-step disturbances. The GUI is organized into panels for system settings, controller parameters, simulation controls, and performance metrics, with real-time plots showing frequency deviation, controller output, and disturbance signals. Users can also export results in MAT, Excel, CSV, or PNG formats for further analysis.

The simulation models the standard governor–turbine–generator loop in state-space form and can demonstrate both open-loop (uncontrolled) and closed-loop (PID-controlled) responses to user-defined load changes. Default parameter values are provided (Tg = 0.08 s, Tt = 0.3 s, H = 6, D = 1, R = 2.4), with safe ranges to ensure numerical stability. The PID controller includes a derivative low-pass filter (coefficient N) and an anti-windup feature to handle actuator saturation. These enhancements turn a poorly regulated open-loop system into a stable and responsive closed-loop system that effectively rejects disturbances and minimizes steady-state errors.
